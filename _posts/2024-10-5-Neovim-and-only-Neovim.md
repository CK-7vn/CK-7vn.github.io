### Neovim is the way, the truth, and the light...to being a better software developer

When the topic of IDE's or workflows come up, you can almost always expect some contention. Especially when there are Emac's or Vim users in the conversation. Now, don't get me wrong, I think big name, business model based editors have their place. I just don't feel like that place is worth going. One of the best things that ever happened at the beginning of my software development journey was being introduced to Vim, and being told that was what I was using, period. (Shout out to PThorpe! Forever in your debt). Learning to develop software through a terminal based editor, from the very beginning, will make you a better developer, there's simply no way around it. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that there simply isn't any good developers that don't use Vim, Neovim, or any other terminal based editor. I'm just saying that using a terminal based editor from the very beginning comes with a lot of un-forseen perks, perks that you don't even realize are there until you're far down the road. Things like, the community that comes with it, the power of the terminal, and the workflow that you develop.  

### The Community
It's an old saying in the Chess world, that if you want to be better, you need to play better players. The same is true in the software development world. If you want to be a better developer, you need to be around and work with better developers. The community that comes with Vim, Neovim, and other terminal based editors is a community of developers that are constantly pushing the boundaries, they're not the developers that are fine with simply building the next javascript framework, they're the developers that are building the tools that the next javascript framework will be built on. Those are the developers you need in your circle, and I know personally that is exactly what I found in my Neovim journey. It wasn't that I was literally going out and having 1:1 calls with these developers, but in the process of messing with my config, and figuring out why this thing, or that thing wasn't exactly how I wanted it, I was inadvertantly being introduced to these developers, I was constantly reading blog posts, articles, or seeing videos from the best of the best. Instead of reading another Medium article about how to set up VS-Code to work with x. I was reading blog posts about how Neovim integrated with my terminal, and the underlying guts of that backbone.
