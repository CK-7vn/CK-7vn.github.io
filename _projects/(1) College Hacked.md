description: A web app I am working on to help people navigate the long (hopefully not) walk to earning higher education. The end goal is a web application that people can go to and with the assistance of AI build a college degree program using other college credit resources, things like CLEP, and ACE credits, instead of using strictly brick and mortar credits. I personally have used a similar path to get my Associates degree in less than one year, and earn upwards of 100 credits from August of 2023, to October of 2024. Currently I am working on training an LLM with data specific to colleges, and college credit.
