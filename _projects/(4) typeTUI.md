description: A TUI typing test with MonkeyType roots! Written in pure Rust. Just incase you're busy working and realize you suddenly forgot how to type, typeTUI can be your go to! Don't fret again about failing fingers, just run a simple `cargo build` ln -s the binary to your .local/bin and in any moments of frantic desperation just run a simple typeTUI command, and type your life away, right in your favorite terminal!
